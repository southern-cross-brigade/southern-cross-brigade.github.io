      <p>The <a href="assets/docs/info-book-2018.pdf" target="_blank">Information Booklet</a> is essential reading for the brigade. Please read this document carefully as it explains many aspects of the brigade and addresses frequently asked questions.</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>To secure your place on the brigade, please fill out this <a href="assets/docs/registration-2019.pdf" target="_blank">registration form</a> and return it to the National Brigade Coordinator, Lia Weitzel at southerncrossbrigade@gmail.com before 31 October.</p>

<p>The information you give in this form must be the same as appears in your current passport. Please call Lia on 0413 753 115 if you need any help filling out the form.</p>

<p>You will also need to pay a non-refundable* $AU250 registration fee. It is important that you advise the National Coordinator by email or phone of your payment once you have completed it, so that we can ensure that your registration is matched to your payment. The registration fee can be paid by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bank cheque, payable to ‘ACFS Brigade’, sent to:<p>
      74 Gossamer Ave<br>
      Mirrabooka WA 6061</p></li>
    <li>EFT, using your name in the reference, e.g. ‘Rego A. SMITH’<p>
      BSB: 066-130 (Commonwealth Bank of Australia)<br>
      Acc No: 10316270<br>
      Acc Name: ACFS Brigade</p></li>
</ul>

<p>*Subject to usual consumer rights laws.</p>

<h2>Cost and Money</h2>

<p>The brigade costs approximately $AU1200 in total, per person, paid in two parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>This includes a non-refundable* registration fee of $AU250 by 31 October to secure your place on the brigade.</li>
  <li>On arrival at the camp in Cuba you will need to pay a further 670 CUC (Cuban Convertible Pesos) in cash, which equates to approximately $AU950.</li>
</ol>

<p>This cost covers all accommodation, food, travel and activities as described in the program for the duration of the brigade, as well as a group t-shirt and cap for each member of the brigade.</p>

<p>This cost does not cover international flights, visas or travel and health insurance. These aspects of your travel must be arranged separately.</p>

<p>Each brigadista must also budget for personal spending money. The Australia Cuba Friendship Society recommends that each brigadista allow for a minimum of $AU800 to cover the cost of optional extras such as souvenirs, toiletries, alcohol, an occasional meal and personally arranged activities as well as luggage excess and personal phone calls.</p>

<p>Please ensure you arrive with Euros, Canadian Dollars or Mexican Pesos. The Australia Cuba Friendship Society recommends that you avoid bringing US dollars, as these incur an extra surcharge to exchange in Cuba. You cannot use or change Australian or New Zealand currency in Cuba. Please follow the guidelines for money in our <a href="assets/docs/info-book-2018.pdf" target="_blank">Information Booklet</a>.</p>

<p>*Subject to usual consumer rights laws.</p>

<h2>Flights</h2>

<p>There are many airlines that fly to and from Cuba.</p>

<p>The Australia Cuba Friendship Society recommends that you do not travel to Cuba via the USA, due to the ongoing US blockade on Cuba. Instead, you might choose to investigate these following airlines that travel to Havana from various locations around the world:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lan Chile, from Santiago de Chile</li>
  <li>Air Canada, from Toronto</li>
  <li>Emirates, from Dubai</li>
  <li>Condor, from Frankfurt</li>
  <li>Cubana Aviacion, from Buenos Aires</li>
  <li>Air China, from Beijing</li>
  <li>KLM, from Amsterdam</li>
  <li>Air France, from Paris</li>
  <li>Aeroméxico, from Cancún, Mexico City</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately flights to Cuba from Australia and New Zealand are often expensive and time consuming. We encourage you to commit early to going on the brigade as the later you register the greater the cost of airfares. Please let us know of any good deals you find for flights to and from Cuba so that we can let other brigadistas know too!</p>

<h2>Visas</h2>

<p>Australians and New Zealanders who wish to travel to Cuba must obtain a visa from the Cuban Embassy in their respective country. The Australia Cuba Friendship Society does not organise visas for brigadistas, so you must obtain one yourself. As a brigadista, you are being invited to Cuba by ICAP (The Cuban Institute for Friendship with the Peoples), a Cuban government body. However, you will still have to apply for a Tourist Visa.</p>

<p>The Tourist Visa can be used within one year from issue. However, once you enter Cuba the visa is valid for a stay of 30 days. If you intend to stay in Cuba after the brigade finishes, you can organise to extend your Tourist Visa with ICAP while in Cuba. You must organise this extension while the brigade is in session as ICAP will not be able to assist you after the brigade has finished</p>

<p>Minors must have their own Tourist Visa.</p>

<p>The following information will be useful when filling out the visa form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The purpose of your visit to Cuba is to participate as a brigadista in the Southern Cross Brigade.</li>
  <li>Your initial address in Cuba is CIJAM (International Camp Julio Antonio Mella), which is located at Caimito Guayabal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Travel and medical insurance</h2>

<p>Since 2010, it has been a requirement of entry into Cuba that all travellers, both foreigners and Cubans living abroad, have medical insurance. To ensure that you comply with this requirement, you will need to have a travel insurance policy with a non-US company that covers medical expenses in Cuba.</p>

<p>The Australia Cuba Friendship Society recommends that brigadistas get their travel insurance prior to entering Cuba so that other brigadistas are not held up at the airport waiting for you to organise this.</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>Brigadistas go to Cuba at the invitation of the Cuban people and government and are therefore ambassadors for their country. Brigadistas are expected to be mindful of the fact that they are part of a solidarity brigade and therefore, they must be courteous and respectful to their hosts and also to each other. Brigadistas are expected to attend all activities listed in the program and to be prompt.</p>

<h2>Information Sessions</h2>

<p>Information sessions on the brigade are run in many regional centres across Australia and New Zealand throughout the year. Please <a href="/contact" target="_blank">contact us</a> to get in touch with your regional brigade coordinator, who can tell you more about the brigade and let you know about any upcoming information sessions.</p>
